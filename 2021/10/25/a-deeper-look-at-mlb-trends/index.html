<p>Baseball is full of crazy trends. Some are incredibly impressive, like the New York Yankees winning five World Series championships (including four in a row) in the 1930s and six in the 1950s. Some are incredibly abysmal, like the Chicago Cubs’ 108-year drought without a World Series championship from 1908 to 2016.</p>
<p>In this blog, I’m going to be taking a look at four different types of trends in Major League Baseball and creating data visualizations for us to view using R-Studio. Let’s begin.</p>
<p>The first trend I want to take a look at is attendance history throughout the MLB, specifically the American League. To start, I’m going to load in our libraries and data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
library(ggrepel)
library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>avgattendance &lt;- read_csv(&quot;~/Desktop/SPMC 350 Files/homework/data/avgattendance.csv&quot;)

attendance &lt;- read_csv(&quot;~/Desktop/SPMC 350 Files/homework/data/alattendance.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>I hope we all can agree that the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox are a part of the greatest rivalry in all professional sports. So let’s take a look at their rivalry in terms of fan attendance since the very beginning.</p>
<p>I’m going to filter out the Yankees and Red Sox from the attendance data frame respectively.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nyy &lt;- attendance %&gt;%
  filter(Team == &quot;NYY&quot;)

bos &lt;- attendance %&gt;%
  filter(Team == &quot;BOS&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Perfect, now both teams have their own data frame. I’m looking specifically at total season attendance numbers. I’ll use ggplot to create the line chart and make additions to clean the chart up.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot() + 
  geom_line(data = attendance, aes(x = Year, y = SeasonTotal, group = Team), color = &quot;light grey&quot;) +
  geom_line(data = nyy, aes(x = Year, y = SeasonTotal, group = Team), linetype = &quot;solid&quot;, color = &quot;#003087&quot;) +
  geom_line(data = bos, aes(x = Year, y = SeasonTotal, group = Team), linetype = &quot;solid&quot;, color = &quot;#BD3039&quot;) +
  geom_line(data = avgattendance, aes(x = Year, y = AvgAttendance), linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 1920, y = 1450000), label = &quot;NYY&quot;) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 1968, y = 2150000), label = &quot;BOS&quot;) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 2008, y = 2100000), label = &quot;AL Average&quot;) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1900,2020, by = 10)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
   labs(
    title = &quot;Yankees and Red Sox attendance trends are back and forth&quot;,
    subtitle = &quot;Wins and losses aren&#39;t the only stats NYY and BOS are competing for.&quot;,
    caption=&quot;Source: Baseball-Almanac | By Ethan Peterson&quot;,
    x = &quot;Year&quot;,
    y = &quot;Season Total Attendance&quot;) + 
    theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = &quot;bold&quot;),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), 
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10), 
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 6, face = &quot;bold.italic&quot;),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
    )</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2021/10/25/a-deeper-look-at-mlb-trends/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, its a lot of up and down. The Yankees, as you might expect, are towards the top in attendance in almost every year across the entire league. There may be around 10 years out of the 118-year span where the Red Sox topped the Yankees in attendance.</p>
<p>One of Boston’s low point in attendance was the late 50s and early 60s, where the team was abysmal. Boston saw a jump in attendance from 2003 to 2013 due to an 820-game sellout streak.</p>
<p>The Yankees boost in attendance in the 1920s was in part to the Babe Ruth acquisition. Overall baseball attendance seemed to drop off after 1947, when Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier, and TV viewership of baseball games surged in the 50s. The steep climb to peak attendance for the Yankees in the early 2000s is from the announcement of new Yankee Stadium (opening in 2009).</p>
<p>The next trend I’m looking at is the recent surge in the majors where hitters are trying for more home runs. While this <em>has</em> resulted in a noticeable increase in home runs, strikeouts have also jumped, too. It’s become the big trend: lots of home runs = lots of strikeouts. The 2021 season was no different. I want to look at the current MVP candidates and plot their HR and SO numbers over the season. Do any stand out?</p>
<p>First, I need to load my library, <code>baseballr</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(baseballr)</code></pre>
<p>My data is unique in that it comes from the library we loaded.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data21 &lt;- daily_batter_bref(&quot;2021-04-01&quot;, &quot;2021-10-03&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>1,006 observations is a lot. I want to narrow it down to a smaller sample. Many hitters had little or no at bats and I don’t want them.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data21 %&gt;%
  filter(AB &gt;= 162) -&gt; criteria21</code></pre>
<p>I chose 162 AB as my cutoff line because that would be a clean 1 AB per game. But that still leaves too many observations. I’ll take the median AB from the new data frame I created.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(criteria21$AB)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##   162.0   243.5   348.0   369.0   492.2   664.0</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>criteria21 %&gt;%
  filter(AB &gt;= 348) -&gt; newcriteria21</code></pre>
<p>193 observations? Perfect. Not too many, not too little.
Next, I’ll filter out my 2021 MVP candidates while also getting the mean home run and strikeout numbers for the chart.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>shohei21 &lt;- newcriteria21 %&gt;% 
  filter(Name == &quot;Shohei Ohtani&quot;)
vladjr21 &lt;- newcriteria21 %&gt;% 
  filter(Name == &quot;Vladimir Guerrero Jr.&quot;)
judge21 &lt;- newcriteria21 %&gt;% 
  filter(Name == &quot;Aaron Judge&quot;)
semien21 &lt;- newcriteria21 %&gt;%
  filter(Name == &quot;Marcus Semien&quot;)
soto21 &lt;- newcriteria21 %&gt;% 
  filter(Name == &quot;Juan Soto&quot;)
harper21 &lt;- newcriteria21 %&gt;% 
  filter(Name == &quot;Bryce Harper&quot;)
tatis21 &lt;- newcriteria21 %&gt;%
  filter(Name == &quot;Fernando Tatis Jr.&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##     meanSO   meanHR
## 1 114.9793 20.21762</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s see how the MVP candidates did at hitting home runs and striking out.</p>

<p>Our finalists are right where they’re expected to be. A couple of players stick out to me. Shohei Ohtani–a two-way player. He struck out the most, but had the second most home runs among MVP candidates, and third overall. Insanely impressive for a generational two-way talent. Vladimir Guerrero Jr., though, is the true standout. He’s tied for the most HR and is below average in strikeouts. Exactly what you like in an MVP. Oh, and he’s <strong>only 22 years old</strong>.</p>
<p>My third trend also involves strikeouts. They’ve been on an upward climb since 2005. A good way to circumvent striking out is walking. How often do our candidates walk? I’ll look at their strikeout rate and their walk rate.
First, I’ll mutate two new variables for SO rate and BB rate. Second, I’ll find the mean of each for an average.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>newcriteria21 %&gt;%                 
  mutate(
    BBrate = ((BB/PA)*100),
    Krate = ((SO/PA)*100),

<p>Three of our candidates have an above average walk rate and below average strikeout rate. But Juan Soto is the clear elephant in the room. He’s in his own universe. He’s the <em>only</em> player with a walk rate above 20%, and his strikeout rate is near the lowest in the league (among qualifiers). The craziest part is that Juan Soto was <em>only 22 years old</em>. A 22-year-old player having this much plate discipline is extremely rare. There’s a reason he’s in the MVP race.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to look at the 2019 Cy Young winners: Justin Verlander (HOU) and Jacob deGrom (NYM). Both players were phenomenal; each deserved the Cy Young Award I’m particularly interested in looking at success in limiting extra base hits (XBH). What proportion of their hits were XBH compared to singles?</p>
<p>I’ll load in our data with <code>baseballr</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pitchdata19 &lt;- daily_pitcher_bref(&quot;2019-03-28&quot;, &quot;2019-09-29&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>I’ll use a waffle chart. To do that, we need to use <code>waffle</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(waffle)</code></pre>
<p>Waffle charts like vectors. It’s all about a proportion of the whole. I’m going to look at each players’ four-hit outcomes in the 2019 season. I need to tally up their total hits by hit type.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>JustinVerlander &lt;- c(&quot;HR&quot; = 36, &quot;3B&quot; = 7, &quot;2B&quot; = 28, &quot;1B&quot; = 66, 17)
JacobdeGrom &lt;- c(&quot;HR&quot; = 19, &quot;3B&quot; = 1, &quot;2B&quot; = 28, &quot;1B&quot; = 106)</code></pre>
<p>What proportion of the hits allowed by the 2019 Cy Young winners were extra base hits?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>iron(

        JustinVerlander,

<p>Off the bat (pun intended), I notice Jacob deGrom gave up way more singles (106 to 66). But Verlander surrendered 36 home runs (28 of them being solo HR) and deGrom only conceded 19. Both pitchers logged 200+ IP, and coincidentally they both allowed the same number of doubles (28).</p>
<p>Verlander led the league with 223 IP; deGrom was close behind with 204. But deGrom gave up 17 more hits than Verlander. Looking back at the data frame used, I cycled through the different statistics. Both of these pitchers were elite. Verlander’s ERA was only 2.58 and deGrom’s was a dominant 2.43. In terms of ERA, those extra 17 home runs that Verlander allowed proved to be costly.</p>
<p>Baseball and it’s trends are fascinating. Finding these trends and being able to find interesting stories inside of them was incredibly enjoyable. Baseball won’t ever go away, and nor will their unique and impressive trends.</p>
