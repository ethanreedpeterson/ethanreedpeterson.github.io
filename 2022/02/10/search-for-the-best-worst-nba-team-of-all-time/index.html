<p><strong>Unfinished, work in progress</strong></p>
<p>Every year, the NBA ends its regular season with three different types of teams. The best overall team, the middle team(s), and the worst overall team. This has been a constant in the sport’s 75-year history. You either have the best record, the worst record, or somewhere in between. The team with the best record (and 19 of the middle teams, now, thanks to the play-in tournament) get a chance to move on and compete in the playoffs, while the team with the worst record and nine similar-record teams pack up and head home early and prepare for the next season.</p>
<p>Being from Nebraska, I was able to witness a hype-filled, heartbreaking, and disappointing football season. A 3-9 record with eight one-score losses and all nine losses being by single-digits (Ohio State by 9). It created an outcry of loyal Husker fans into crowning that team the title of the “best worst team in college football” and the “best 3-9 football team ever” as an attempt to distract themselves from what a terribly upsetting season it was.</p>
<p>I have a passion for statistics and data in the sports world, and basketball has such a mountainous amount of data, specifically on Basketball-Reference, that I comb through every day. The Huskers’ football season brought about the idea of doing the same thing but with the NBA. I’m looking to find the best worst basketball team ever, based on the worst win percentage. I’ll be looking at the two teams with the worst win percentage from the 1976 season (ABA/NBA merger) to 2021, bringing my sample size to 90 different teams. I’ll be looking at different team statistics and creating visualizations to see how close / accurate I can be in determining the best worst NBA team of all time.</p>
