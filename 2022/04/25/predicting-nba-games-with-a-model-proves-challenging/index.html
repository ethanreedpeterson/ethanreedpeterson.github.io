<p><strong>Explaining methods, features of the model, and algorithm here.</strong></p>
<p>–</p>
<p>When it came to deciding whether or not we wanted to go with the model’s choice of who would win or not for our bets, we tended to rely more on who <em>we</em> felt would win the games over the model’s choice instead. The model doesn’t know who is playing, momentum, and other obscene and abstract factors that we can’t sum up and put into a model. So a lot of it was, <em>“Well, the model says this, what do we think?”</em> and we’d decide from there. At the beginning, we knew the Mavericks weren’t a stone-cold lock because Luka Dončić was out for a couple of games. Collectively, our picks were based on the following questions. How has the team performed recently? Are their star players going to be playing at full speed? Does the model agree with how we’re feeling? And how big (or small) are the odds for each team?</p>
<p><strong>How it went, our record, overall finishing position here.</strong></p>
<p>–</p>
<p><strong>What did we learn (about modeling, gambling, and ourselves) during this here.</strong></p>
