    <div class="article-content">
      <p>My name is Ethan Peterson. I was born and raised in small-town Nebraska. I graduated from Cross County High School in Stromsburg, NE. I am currently attending the University of Nebraska-Lincoln majoring in sociology and minoring in statistics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had a giant passion for sports. Baseball was, and still is, my favorite sport. I grew up a die hard Yankees fan (thanks to my father, who, has no relation to the state of New York. The Yankees were just on TV all of the time in the 70s and that&rsquo;s who he watched).
In 2009, I started watching the NBA and picked the Lakers as &ldquo;my team&rdquo; because they were yellow. My favorite color is yellow, unsurprisingly.
Since then, my love for the two sports exponentially grew. I also, as one in Nebraska should, grew up a die hard Husker football fan. Recently, it&rsquo;s been tough&hellip;but we&rsquo;re on the right track. I can feel it.</p>
<p>My love for sports statistics started with baseball. I just loved all of the random numbers that were used to detail and illustrate just how good a player was at a certain facet of the game. When I came into college, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I wanted to do. But, after taking a sports data visualization and analytics class fall of my junior year, I realized how much I wanted to do sports data analytics for a career.</p>
