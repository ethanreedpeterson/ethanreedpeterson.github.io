      <description>This spring, our SPMC 460 class was tasked with creating a machine learning model to predict the outcome of the Menâ€™s March Madness tournament. We had multiple options of models to choose from: logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and support vector machines. I elected to go with a support vector machine (SVM), simply because it seemed like it would work the best for me.
Part of creating the learning model is using self-picked predictors.</description>
