      <description>Every year, the NBA ends its regular season with three different types of teams. The best overall team, the middle team(s), and the worst overall team. This has been a constant in the sport’s 75-year history. You either have the best record, the worst record, or somewhere in between. The team with the best record (and 19 of the middle teams, now, thanks to the play-in tournament) get a chance to move on and compete in the playoffs, while the team with the worst record and nine similar-record teams pack up and head home early and prepare for the next season.</description>

      <description>The NBA is in the midst of a game style shift. The 3-point shot is being attempted at record high numbers, and virtually every other shot at record lows. I’m interested to see how 3-point attempts (3PA) have changed in recent years and if there’s been an effect on rookies becoming more long-ball focused. As an unrelated bonus, I’m going to look at Dean Oliver’s “Four Factors of Basketball Success” when compared to championship teams.</description>
