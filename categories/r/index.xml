      <description>&#34;The First true basketball game as we know it was on January 20th, 1892 in Springfield, Massachusetts. Canadian Doctor James Naismith invented the game for the YMCA to play during the winter months. Naismith wrote simple rules for the game, and nailed up two peach baskets for hoops, most of original Naismith rules are still in place today. Some of the rules have changed a bit, and new rules have been added since then, such as in the original game bouncing the ball was prohibited.</description>

Some are incredibly abysmal, like the Chicago Cubs’ 108-year drought without a World Series championship from 1908 to 2016.
In this blog, I’m going to be taking a look at four different types of trends in Major League Baseball and creating data visualizations for us to view using R-Studio.</description>
