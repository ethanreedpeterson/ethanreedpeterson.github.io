      <description>This spring, our SPMC 460 class was tasked with creating a machine learning model to predict the outcome of the Men’s March Madness tournament. We had multiple options of models to choose from: logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and support vector machines. I elected to go with a support vector machine (SVM), simply because it seemed like it would work the best for me.
Part of creating the learning model is using self-picked predictors.</description>

      <description>The NBA is in the midst of a game style shift. The 3-point shot is being attempted at record high numbers, and virtually every other shot at record lows. I’m interested to see how 3-point attempts (3PA) have changed in recent years and if there’s been an effect on rookies becoming more long-ball focused. As an unrelated bonus, I’m going to look at Dean Oliver’s “Four Factors of Basketball Success” when compared to championship teams.</description>
