      <description>The NBA is in the midst of a game style shift. The 3-point shot is being attempted at record high numbers, and virtually every other shot at record lows.

As an unrelated bonus, I’m going to look at Dean Oliver’s “Four Factors of Basketball Success” when compared to championship teams.</description>
